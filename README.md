# Emoji Mood Board

This is a playful drag-and-drop web app. Pick an emoji from the panel and drop it on the canvas to create your mood board. Use the **Clear Canvas** button to start over. Double-click or scroll your mouse wheel over a dropped emoji to adjust its size. When you're done, click **Download Canvas** to save your board as an image.
